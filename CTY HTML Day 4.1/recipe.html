<h3>Rice</h3>
<div class="pbjtext">
    <p>DIRECTIONS
    <br>1.  Get started by boiling 2 cups of water in a covered pot. When the water has reached a boil, add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 cup of white rice.
    <br>2.  Cover the pot and let it simmer for 18-20 minutes. As tempting as it may be, try not to stir or lift the lid while the rice is cooking.
    <br>3.  Once the rice looks as fluffy as can be, take it off the burner and let it sit for 5 minutes. This cooling process allows the rice to steam and become the soft — but not too soft — consistency that we all strive for.
    <br>4.  Add more texture to the rice by fluffing it with a fork. Before serving, top it off with 1/2 cup of chopped herbs (we love cilantro and parsley!).
